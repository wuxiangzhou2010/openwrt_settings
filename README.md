# wifi setting backup

### Background
I have no cable access to the internet(hacked wifi).
Luckily, I have one Raspberry Pi 3 which  has one LAN RJ45 and wireless access at the same time. 
Behind the Raspberry Pi3， I have the WNDR4300, this can be used as a normal router, but need some configuration.
